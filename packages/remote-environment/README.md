# Remote-environment
The complete context dictionary for given environment ðŸ’«.

This library contain a key-value map of the requested context, accessing the objects with their 
real paths such as `"Object.getPrototypeOf"`. All the contexts include only a variables that are 
unique for this environment and can't recreate again manually. For Example, the PI number 
`3.141592653589793` is not a unique variable but the function `Math.sin` is unique and therefore 
will be available under the path `"Math.sin"`.

## Install
```
npm install remote-environment
```

## Usage
```js
// Load the requested environment 
const context = require('remote-environment/es6');

// Access the environment objects
context['Object']; // equals to `Object`
context['Math.sin']; // equals to `Math.sin`
context['Promise.resolve']; // equals to `Promise.resolve`
context['Function.prototype']; // equals to `Function.prototype`
```

## Supported Environments

**Remote-environment** is currently supporting only limited number of environment contexts.
To use an environment you should require it explicitly:

```js
const context = require('remote-environment/ENV_NAME');
```

When `ENV_NAME` is the required environment name.

Name | Status | Description
--- | --- | ---
`es6` | UNSTABLE | An ES6 context. This environment consider unstable and may change over the versions.
